# Form Validation (Client-side form validation)
### Client side form validation uses custom vanilla JS without constraint validation API for more form control.
### This mockup form doesn't submit data to the server, but instead simulates a form submission by resetting the input values and displaying a confetti (if all form inputs are valid).
